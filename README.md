# Random Quote Machine

Random Quote Machine is a project I made while learning React.js framework. This project was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries Projects found [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).

## About

Project was initialized by using `npx create-react-app` command. Deleted the default stuff and added a JSON containing some quotes. On site refresh a new color and quote is randomized and displayed.
